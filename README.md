# Efficient-Frontier-Generator
Overview
The Efficiency Frontier Generator is a Python-based tool designed to compute and visualize the efficient frontier for a given set of assets. The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk, or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.

Features
Input asset returns data
Calculate expected returns and covariance matrix
Generate random portfolios
Calculate the efficient frontier
Visualize the efficient frontier
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Required libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
SciPy (for optimization)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
